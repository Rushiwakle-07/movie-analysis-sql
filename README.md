## 🎬 Movie Database Analysis: Global Cinema Insights
## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of a global cinema database consisting of 300+ movies, 500 actors, and 2,000 user ratings. The goal was to extract meaningful insights regarding movie profitability, genre trends, and user engagement using MySQL.

## 📊 Dataset Structure
The database consists of 7 interconnected tables:

movies: Central table containing title, budget, revenue, and release info.

actors: Details about international actors and their awards.

directors: Information on the visionaries behind the films.

genres: Classification of movies (Action, Sci-Fi, etc.).

movie_actors: Junction table mapping actors to specific movie roles.

ratings: User-generated scores and qualitative feedback.

users: Demographic data of the global audience.

## 🚀 Key Business Questions Answered
I divided the analysis into two phases to demonstrate a range of SQL technical skills:

🔹 Basic Level
Filtering data by release year and language.

Aggregating total awards and calculating demographic counts.

Sorting top-performing assets by budget and duration.

🔹 Intermediate Level
Multi-table Joins: Connecting films to genres and directors.

Data Aggregation: Calculating average ratings per movie and identifying high-activity actors using GROUP BY and HAVING.

Financial Analysis: Calculating ROI (Profit) by subtracting Budget from Box Office.

Relationship Mapping: Identifying lead actors in specific high-profile titles.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills Used
Database: MySQL

SQL Skills: - Complex Joins (INNER, LEFT)

Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Filtering & Pattern Matching (LIKE, IN, WHERE)

Subqueries for dynamic filtering

Data Cleaning & Aliasing

## 📂 Project Files
